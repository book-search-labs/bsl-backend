Implement ticket: T-0211 — Local OpenSearch v1.1: AC + authors + series + alias seed
SSOT file: /mnt/data/T-0211-local-opensearch-v1_1-ac-authors-series-alias-seed-REDOWNLOAD.md

Goal
- Extend local OpenSearch setup to support v1.1 search/autocomplete needs:
  - Create/ensure indexes for autocomplete + author + series (as defined in the ticket)
  - Create/ensure read/write aliases (idempotent)
  - Seed minimal demo documents so searches actually return results
  - Keep everything runnable via existing local scripts (docker compose / local_up / seed scripts), update RUNBOOK only if needed.

Hard requirements
- MUST be idempotent: running the scripts multiple times should not fail and should not duplicate data unexpectedly.
- MUST NOT modify application services code (services/**) except if the ticket explicitly allows (follow the ticket).
- Prefer scripts under scripts/ or infra/local-opensearch/ (use existing repo conventions).
- Use aliases for reads/writes (e.g., *_read / *_write) and do not hardcode physical index names in app code.
- If existing T-0210 created books_doc_* and books_vec_* aliases, keep them; add what T-0211 requires without breaking current setup.

What to do
1) Read AGENTS.md and docs/RUNBOOK.md and follow repo rules.
2) Locate the local OpenSearch bootstrap scripts from T-0210 (local_up.sh, seed scripts, compose files, etc.).
3) Implement T-0211 exactly:
  - Create the indices/mappings/settings for:
    - Autocomplete (ac_*)
    - Authors index
    - Series index
    - Any other indices mentioned in the ticket
  - Add/ensure aliases (read/write) for each.
  - Add seed data for each index (small but meaningful; deterministic IDs).
4) Add verification helpers:
  - A script or documented curl commands to verify aliases, mappings, and sample queries (autocomplete prefix + authors/series lookup).
5) Update docs/RUNBOOK.md only with a short section if required.

Acceptance
- On a clean checkout:
  - ./scripts/local_up.sh (or repo equivalent) brings up OpenSearch and creates all indices+aliases.
  - Seed script runs successfully.
  - curl -s http://localhost:9200/_cat/aliases?v shows expected aliases.
  - Sample queries from the ticket return non-empty hits.

Output
- Provide a concise summary:
  - files changed
  - how to run (commands)
  - verification commands (copy/paste)
  - any limitations

Now implement.
