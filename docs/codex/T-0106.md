Ticket: T-0106 — Web User: Book-style UI shell + router (MVP)

Goal
- Implement a “book site–friendly” UI shell for the web-user Vite (React + TS) app:
  - Top header with logo/title, global search bar, and simple nav
  - Main content area with routed pages
  - Footer
  - Works on desktop + mobile (basic responsive)
- Add React Router routes:
  - "/" -> Home (book-ish landing)
  - "/search" -> Search (placeholder for now; real search in next tickets)
  - "/book/:docId" -> BookDetail (placeholder)
  - "/about" -> About (optional)
- Keep dependencies minimal: use what already exists in package.json (React, React Router, Bootstrap/react-bootstrap if
  installed). No new UI kits.

Constraints
- Do NOT modify backend services.
- Do NOT introduce heavy state libraries.
- Do NOT add authentication.
- Use environment variables via Vite (.env.example already exists or create if missing):
  - VITE_SEARCH_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080
  - VITE_QUERY_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8001

Implementation details
1) Directory & structure
- Under the web-user app, create/organize:
  - src/app/AppRouter.tsx (router setup)
  - src/layouts/AppShell.tsx (header/footer/layout)
  - src/pages/HomePage.tsx
  - src/pages/SearchPage.tsx
  - src/pages/BookDetailPage.tsx
  - src/pages/AboutPage.tsx (optional)
  - src/styles/app.css (or reuse existing index.css)

2) AppShell layout
- Header:
  - Brand title "BSL Books"
  - Search input (controlled) + “Search” button
  - On submit, navigate to /search?q=<encoded>
  - Simple nav links: Home, Search, About
- Main:
  - <Outlet/> for routed content
- Footer:
  - small text: "BSL Book Search Labs — MVP"

3) Router
- Use react-router-dom v7:
  - createBrowserRouter / RouterProvider OR BrowserRouter + Routes (either is fine)
- Wire App.tsx to render the router/shell.
- Ensure 404 fallback page:
  - route "*" -> NotFoundPage.tsx (create it)

4) Styling / UX
- Use Bootstrap grid and spacing.
- Responsive:
  - Search bar should stack on small screens.
- HomePage:
  - Hero section with headline and description
  - A few “category chips” as buttons (no behavior yet)
  - A “Try searching: 해리포터 1권” clickable suggestion that routes to /search?q=...

5) Env wiring (read-only)
- Add .env.example if missing (do not commit real .env).
- In AboutPage (or footer tooltip), show the env base URLs in a <pre> for sanity:
  - import.meta.env.VITE_SEARCH_BASE_URL
  - import.meta.env.VITE_QUERY_BASE_URL

6) Run instructions
- Update web-user README.md (or create) with:
  - npm install
  - cp .env.example .env
  - npm run dev -- --port 5174 (use 5174 for web-user to avoid admin collision)

Acceptance
- `npm install` and `npm run dev` succeed.
- Visiting:
  - / shows Home layout
  - /search shows placeholder page and reads q from URL
  - /book/b1 shows placeholder detail page with docId param
- Header search navigates to /search?q=...
- No extra dependencies added unless absolutely necessary.

Deliverables
- Provide a short summary of changed/created files and how to run locally.
