Ticket: U-0111 — Web User: Book Detail deep-link + refresh via Search Service GET /books/:docId

Goal
- Make /book/:docId work on deep-link and refresh:
  - If sessionStorage has last selected book => render immediately.
  - Otherwise fetch from Search Service GET /books/{docId} and render.
- Keep current UI/UX from U-0109 (session storage) but add server fallback.

Scope (Allowed)
- apps/web-user/** only

Forbidden
- services/**
- apps/web-admin/**
- contracts/**
- infra/**
- db/**

Environment
- web-user runs on port 5174 (fixed).
- Use Vite env:
  - VITE_SEARCH_SERVICE_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080
- Ensure apps/web-user/.env.example contains that key (add if missing).
- Ensure .env is gitignored.

Implementation Requirements
1) API client
- Add (or extend) src/api/searchService.ts:
  - getBookByDocId(docId: string) -> calls:
    GET {VITE_SEARCH_SERVICE_BASE_URL}/books/{docId}
  - Use existing fetchJson helper if present; otherwise add minimal http helper with good error messages.

2) BookDetailPage behavior
- Route is /book/:docId (confirm existing route).
- On mount:
  - read docId param
  - try to load from sessionStorage (key used in U-0109)
    - if it matches docId => render
  - else:
    - set loading state
    - fetch getBookByDocId(docId)
    - store result into sessionStorage as the latest selected book
    - render
- Error UI:
  - show friendly error banner
  - include Retry button
  - if 404 => show “Book not found” message

3) Keep UI consistent
- Reuse existing Book detail layout/styles.
- Show docId somewhere small (debug-ish) optional.

4) Manual test steps
- Run web-user: npm run dev -- --port 5174
- Visit /search, click a hit -> detail page works
- Copy detail URL, open in new tab (deep-link) -> should still show (fetch path)
- Refresh -> still shows (fetch path)

Important
- Do not touch unrelated files (especially tasks/). If you see unrelated git changes, ignore them and proceed only within the allowed scope.

Deliverables
- List changed/created files
- How to run locally
- Curl example for the backend endpoint used
