Ticket: B-0213 — Autocomplete Service: GET /autocomplete (MVP)

Goal
- Implement Autocomplete API in services/autocomplete-service (NOT search-service).
- Endpoint: GET /autocomplete?q=<string>&size=<int>
- Response JSON:
  {
  "trace_id": "...",
  "request_id": "...",
  "took_ms": 12,
  "suggestions": [{ "text": "해리 포터", "score": 0.9, "source": "mvp" }]
  }

Constraints
- Only modify services/autocomplete-service/** (and optionally docs/RUNBOOK.md for a short curl snippet).
- Do NOT modify services/search-service/** in this ticket.

Implementation requirements
1) Routing
- Add a controller/route that handles:
  - q: required string (trim, reject blank)
  - size: optional int default 8, clamp 1..20
- Generate trace_id/request_id if missing; also accept x-trace-id / x-request-id headers if present.

2) Logic (MVP)
- If OpenSearch wiring exists in autocomplete-service already, query it.
- If not, implement a simple deterministic suggestion generator:
  - Example: [q, q + " 1권", q + " 리커버", q + " 시리즈", q + " 저자"]
  - Deduplicate, cap to size
  - Set score descending (1.0, 0.9, 0.8...) and source="mvp"

3) Observability fields
- Measure took_ms and include in response.

4) Local run documentation
- Update services/autocomplete-service README.md (or add a short section) with:
  - how to run locally
  - the server port (read from config; do not guess)
  - curl test example

Acceptance
- Service starts successfully.
- curl "http://localhost:<PORT>/autocomplete?q=해리&size=5" returns suggestions with the expected JSON shape.
- No changes occur in search-service.
  Deliverables
- List changed files + how to run locally + curl example.
