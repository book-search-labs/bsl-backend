Ticket: B-0212 — Search Service: Book Detail API by docId

Goal
- Add a minimal endpoint to Search Service to fetch a single book by docId.
- This unblocks Web User deep-link / refresh on /book/:docId.

Scope (Allowed)
- services/search-service/** only
- docs/RUNBOOK.md (optional small snippet)

Forbidden
- apps/**
- contracts/**
- infra/**
- db/**
- services/query-service/**
- services/ranking-service/**

Requirements
1) API
- Add GET /books/{docId}
- Response: { "doc_id": "...", "source": { ... }, "trace_id": "...", "request_id": "...", "took_ms": N }
  - source should match existing hit source mapping fields (title_ko, authors, publisher_name, issued_year, volume, edition_labels, etc.)
- If not found: 404 with { "error": { "code": "not_found", "message": "..." }, "trace_id": "...", "request_id": "..." }
- If OpenSearch unavailable: 503
- Unexpected: 500

2) IDs
- Read x-trace-id / x-request-id headers if present; else generate UUID-based values.
- Echo those IDs in response (success and error).

3) OpenSearch
- Fetch from the SAME read alias used for search:
  - books_doc_read
- Implement via existing OpenSearchGateway:
  - Add a small gateway method like getById(docId, timeoutMs?) if missing.
  - Best-effort timeout can reuse existing request timeout strategy.

4) Mapping
- Reuse existing mapping logic used in search hits (BookHit.Source mapping).
- Keep it deterministic; no extra computation.

5) Tests
- Add unit test(s) (MockMvc + mocked OpenSearchGateway):
  - 200 when found (returns doc_id + source)
  - 404 when not found
  - IDs propagation

6) Runbook (optional)
- Add curl example:
  curl -s http://localhost:8080/books/b1

Important
- Do not touch unrelated files (especially tasks/). If you see unrelated git changes, ignore them and proceed only within the allowed scope.

Deliverables
- List changed files
- How to run tests (./gradlew test)
- Curl examples
