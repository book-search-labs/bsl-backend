Implement the ticket: tasks/backlog/T-0210-local-opensearch-v1_1-doc-vec-alias-seed.md

Rules:
- Read and follow AGENTS.md.
- Stay within scope: ONLY modify infra/**, scripts/**, docs/RUNBOOK.md.
- Do NOT touch services/**, contracts/**, db/**.

Deliverables:
- compose.yaml (opensearch single-node with healthcheck)
- infra/opensearch/books_doc_v1.mapping.json
- infra/opensearch/books_vec_v1.mapping.json
- scripts/os_bootstrap_indices_v1_1.sh
- scripts/os_seed_books_v1_1.sh
- scripts/local_up.sh (compose up + wait + bootstrap + seed)
- scripts/local_down.sh
- docs/RUNBOOK.md update

Validation:
After changes, run these commands and ensure they pass:
1) chmod +x scripts/*.sh
2) ./scripts/local_down.sh
3) ./scripts/local_up.sh
4) curl -s http://localhost:9200/_cat/aliases?v
5) Run the lexical smoke query (must have hits >= 1)
6) Run the knn smoke query (must have hits >= 1)

Make sure bulk NDJSON ends with a newline and scripts use `set -euo pipefail`.
